<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>Dorothy Gale lives with her Cairn Terrier dog Toto on the Kansas farm of her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. Toto bites witchy neighbor Miss Almira Gulch, who then obtains an order for Toto to be euthanized. She takes Toto away on her bicycle, but he escapes and returns to Dorothy, who decides to run away from home to save her dog.
<br />
<br />
They meet Professor Marvel, a kindly fortune teller who uses his crystal ball to make Dorothy believe that Aunt Em may be dying of a broken heart. Dorothy races home, arriving just as a powerful tornado strikes. Locked out of the farm's storm cellar, she seeks shelter in her bedroom. Wind-blown debris knocks her unconscious and the house is sent spinning in the air. She awakens to see various figures fly by, including Miss Gulch, who transforms into witch on a broomstick.
<br />
<br />
The house lands in Munchkinland in the Land of Oz. Glinda the Good Witch of the North and the Munchkins welcome her as a heroine, as the falling house has killed the Wicked Witch of the East; only the witch's legs and the ruby slippers on her feet are visible. Her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West, arrives to claim the slippers, but Glinda transports them onto Dorothy's feet first. The Wicked Witch of the West swears revenge on Dorothy for her sister's death, then vanishes. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, where she can ask the Wizard of Oz to help her get back home.
<br />
<br />
On her journey Dorothy meets the Scarecrow, who wants a brain; the Tin Woodman, who desires a heart; and the Cowardly Lion, who needs courage. Dorothy invites them to accompany her to the Emerald City, where they can ask the Wizard to help them too. Despite harassment from the Witch they reach the Emerald City and are eventually permitted to see the Wizard, who appears as a large ghostly head surrounded by fire and smoke. He agrees to grant their wishes if they prove their worth by bringing him the Witch's broomstick.
<br />
<br />
As the four (plus Toto) make their way to the Witch's castle, the Witch sends her winged monkeys to capture Dorothy and Toto. At the castle, the Witch realizes that Dorothy must be dead before they can be removed. Toto escapes and leads her three friends to the castle. They ambush three guards, don the guards' uniforms, and march inside to locate Dorothy. The Witch and her guards chase them through the castle and surround them. When the Witch sets fire to the Scarecrow, Dorothy tosses a bucket of water at him; water also splashes the Witch, who melts away. The guards rejoice and give Dorothy the broomstick.
<br />
<br />
Back in the Emerald City, as the Wizard stalls in fulfilling his promises Toto pulls back a curtain and exposes the "Wizard" as a middle-aged speaking through a microphone. He denies Dorothy's accusation that he is a bad man, but admits to being a humbug. He then gives the Scarecrow a diploma, the Lion a medal, and the Tin Man a ticking heart-shaped watch, helping them see that the attributes they sought (brains, heart, courage) were already within them. He then offers to take Dorothy and Toto home in his hot air balloon.
<br />
<br />
As Dorothy and the Wizard prepare to depart, there is a mishap and the balloon leaves with only the Wizard. Glinda appears and tells Dorothy that the Ruby Slippers will take her home. Following Glinda's instructions, Dorothy taps her heels together three times and repeats, "There's no place like home".
Dorothy wakes up in Kansas surrounded by her family and friends. Everyone dismisses her adventure as a dream, but Dorothy insists it was real, and says she has learned there is no place like home

	<li>Other Notes: Families can talk about elements of The Wizard of Oz that 70 years later can be found in contemporary films. What other popular movies follow a main hero and his supportive friends on an important journey? 

    Discuss the way that the movie combines several genres. How does the change from black-and-white to color affect the movie's tone?
<br />
<br />
    How does the Scarecrow demonstrate his intelligence, the Tin Man his heart, and the Lion his courage? How does each one find what he needs within himself?
<br />
<br />
    How do the characters in The Wizard of Oz demonstrate perseverance, teamwork, and courage? Why are these important character strengths? 
<br />
<br />
    How does Dorothy learn empathy, integrity, and gratitude over the course of her journey in Oz? How does she learn to be true to herself? What is she most grateful for by the end?</li>
